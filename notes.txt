IMPORTANT REMARKS
• your “popular product” should be accessible by non-specialists.
Like the lectures of this course: it should not require any technical knowledge.
• If you do group work, make sure that each group member contribute substantially.
The contribution should spelled out clearly in your product.
Each group member submits the work on Moodle (no group submission).
• Evaluation criteria:
(1) how well your “popular product” is connected with the ideas of this course
(2) how original is your product
(3) how accessible is your product (i.e. non-technical, easy to enjoy)

Write solution page for each puzzle.

TODO:
Solution

Fact Check (Done after every stuff)

Introduction (aka README, explanations, etc.)
- Create it ffs

Polishing:
- Package Delivery (!!!)

Assets: 
- Missing: Unstable crates / Missing Label 1, 2 / Alice and Bob / Package Delivery

Unstable Crate:
- Add animation when you measure device (make waveform goes whooooom)
=> When writing solution, say it is inspired by the qubit game?

Alice and Bob's Entanglement
- Somehow express their Entanglement relationship using art / canvas / whatever

Graphics can come later.
