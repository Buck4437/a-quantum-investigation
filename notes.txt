IMPORTANT REMARKS
• your “popular product” should be accessible by non-specialists.
Like the lectures of this course: it should not require any technical knowledge.
• If you do group work, make sure that each group member contribute substantially.
The contribution should spelled out clearly in your product.
Each group member submits the work on Moodle (no group submission).
• Evaluation criteria:
(1) how well your “popular product” is connected with the ideas of this course
(2) how original is your product
(3) how accessible is your product (i.e. non-technical, easy to enjoy)

I will use a password system on the main page to mark completions.
Write solution page for each puzzle.

TODO:
Overall structure:
- Make password system
- I want to add some kind of story 
- Assets

Introduction
- Make sure it works

Alice and Bob's Entanglement
- Add assets for Alice, Bob, and then somehow express their Entanglement relationship using art / canvas / whatever
- Add password

Entangled Cube
- Add password

Dating simulator (WIP):
- Remake (Idea: convert to quantum lottery, and you need to try and rig it so that you win)
- Use a sequence of move to increase the probability dating success from 10^-12% to 100%.

Entangled puzzle:
- Introduction: Two parts, password hv 2 parts as well (just plain text)
    Also need a playground lol

Note: Might have to be tested in local server

- Idea 1: Measure a qubit in 2 different directions, lead to 4 different pictures of puz in another tab
- Idea 2: A series of numbres in two different puzzles that are entangled somehow

Superposition
- Catch the thief game (?)
- Quantum Card Game?
- Make words, but you need to use quantum letters


Ideas from ChatGPT:
- Quantum State Manipulation: Players can manipulate objects or elements in the game to exist in superpositions of different states. The objective is to use these superposed states strategically to solve puzzles. For example, a puzzle might require aligning objects in such a way that their superposed states interact constructively to unlock a door or reveal a hidden path.
- Quantum Marble Puzzle: Objective: The objective of this puzzle is to determine the location of a quantum marble placed in a grid by using clues that involve quantum superposition.
- Quantum Word Puzzle: Objective: Reveal a hidden word by deducing the correct order of letters based on clues involving quantum superposition.
