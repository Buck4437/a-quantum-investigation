IMPORTANT REMARKS
• your “popular product” should be accessible by non-specialists.
Like the lectures of this course: it should not require any technical knowledge.
• If you do group work, make sure that each group member contribute substantially.
The contribution should spelled out clearly in your product.
Each group member submits the work on Moodle (no group submission).
• Evaluation criteria:
(1) how well your “popular product” is connected with the ideas of this course
(2) how original is your product
(3) how accessible is your product (i.e. non-technical, easy to enjoy)

Write solution page for each puzzle.

TODO:
Introduction (aka README, explanations, etc.)
- Create it ffs

Superposition:
- Quantum 24 (correct regardless of state) / Quantum thief / Quantum Card Game

Unstable Crate:
- Add password
- Add asssets
- Add animation when you measure device (make waveform goes whooooom)
=> When writing solution, say it is inspired by the qubit game?

Alice and Bob's Entanglement
- Add assets for Alice, Bob, and then somehow express their Entanglement relationship using art / canvas / whatever

Ideas from ChatGPT:
- Quantum State Manipulation: Players can manipulate objects or elements in the game to exist in superpositions of different states. The objective is to use these superposed states strategically to solve puzzles. For example, a puzzle might require aligning objects in such a way that their superposed states interact constructively to unlock a door or reveal a hidden path.
- Quantum Marble Puzzle: Objective: The objective of this puzzle is to determine the location of a quantum marble placed in a grid by using clues that involve quantum superposition.
- Quantum Word Puzzle: Objective: Reveal a hidden word by deducing the correct order of letters based on clues involving quantum superposition.
