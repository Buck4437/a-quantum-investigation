IMPORTANT REMARKS
• your “popular product” should be accessible by non-specialists.
Like the lectures of this course: it should not require any technical knowledge.
• If you do group work, make sure that each group member contribute substantially.
The contribution should spelled out clearly in your product.
Each group member submits the work on Moodle (no group submission).
• Evaluation criteria:
(1) how well your “popular product” is connected with the ideas of this course
(2) how original is your product
(3) how accessible is your product (i.e. non-technical, easy to enjoy)
