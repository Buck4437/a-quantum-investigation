                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>
                    This is a puzzle hunt. Your primary objective is to solve puzzles.

                </p>

                <h3>Solutions and afterwords</h3>

                <p>
                    All solutions and afterwords can be found on this page. 
                    I highly recommend checking this page AFTER you have solved the final puzzle. However, 
                    if you are stuck, you can find solutions to most puzzles here.
                </p>
