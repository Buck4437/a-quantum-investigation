                    <p>
                        This is a puzzle hunt. Your primary objective is to solve puzzles by entering memos on the main page.
                        Even though this puzzle hunt is based on quantum mechanics, pre-requisite knowledge is not required.
                        They will be introduced throughout the puzzle hunt.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most puzzles come with interactive components. Most of them are experiments involving 
                        quantum mechanics or analogies of concepts in quantum physics. However, some of them will
                        involve puzzle-solving elements.

                    <p>
                        All answers in this puzzle hunt will be referred to as <span class="password">memos</span>.
                        If you see the word <span class="password">memo</span>, or when things are highlighted in 
                        <span class="password">aqua</span>, chances are, the highlighted text is / is related to
                        the answer to the puzzle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All answers are common English words. Furthermore, except for the final puzzle,
                        all answers will be given in plain text and IN UPPERCASE. The answer is case-insensitive, and all
                        space characters are removed automatically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note that <span class="red">your puzzle progresses are not saved</span>. All progress will be lost when 
                        you reload the pages. I highly recommend keeping a backup of all puzzle answers in case
                        the page is reloaded automatically.
                    </p>

                        I highly recommend checking this page ONLY AFTER you have solved the final puzzle.<br><br>
                        All solutions and afterwords can be found on <a href="../../solution/index.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.
                        If you are stuck, you can find solutions to most puzzles here.
