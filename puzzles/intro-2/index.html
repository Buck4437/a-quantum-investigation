                        "Welcome back, Max," Stephen greeted you at the entrance.

                        "Following the tradition of the Q-warehouse, I have decided to join the <span class="password">QUANTUM</span> revolution. 
                        Surprisingly, my research has actually went pretty well, and my experiments didn't end with a massive explosion."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "So, what's the problem?" You asked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Well, recently there have been a deluge of problems going on with the warehouse, inside and outside.
                        All the problems are relatively minor, as least when compared to my quasar experiments, but it's the abundance of them
                        that troubled me. Also, the biggest issue is that all the problems seem to be related to <span class="password">QUANTUM</span>. Maybe it has to 
                        do with my experiments..."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You nodded your head. "Well, I guess I could help you with the problems, but first I will probably need an introduction on... <span class="password">QUANTUM</span>.
                        Isn't it some kind of esoteric concepts that only mad scientists can approach?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Nah, all you need is a basic understanding of the concepts, and then you can <span class="password">QUANTUM</span> as much as I do.
                        Why don't you follow me, I will show you stuff that I have been working on."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You followed him inside the warehouse. As a habit of yours, you pulled up your memo and jotted down a keyword that seems to be <span class="password">very important</span>.
