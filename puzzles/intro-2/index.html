                        "Welcome back, Max," Stephen greeted you at the entrance. 
                    </p>

                    <img src="src/warehouse.png" width="300" height="300">

                    <p>
                        "I have decided to join the <span class="password">QUANTUM</span> revolution. 
                        My research has actually gone pretty well, and the experiments didn't end with massive explosions."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You remembered his old experiments with quasars. It didn't end very well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "So, what's the problem?" You asked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Well, there have been a deluge of problems within the warehouse.
                        Odd enough, all the problems seem to be related to <span class="password">QUANTUM</span> mechanics. 
                        Maybe it has to do with my experiments..."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You nodded your head. "Well, I could help you with the problems, but 
                        I will probably need an introduction on... <span class="password">QUANTUM</span>.
                        Isn't it some kind of esoteric concept that only mad scientists can understand?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Nah, all you need is a basic understanding of the concepts, 
                        and then you can <span class="password">QUANTUM</span> as much as I do.
                        Why don't you follow me, I will show you stuff that I have been working on."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You followed him inside the warehouse. As a habit of yours, you opened up your memo 
                        and jotted down a <span class="password">keyword</span> that seems to be very important.
