                        You woke up with a knock on the door. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Hey Max, Stephen is asking for your help again," you opened the door and saw
                        Nicholas, your good friend.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Stephen is a good pal of yours> He has also started a company called "Q-ware". He has
                        asked for your help in the past, and previous encounters have suggested...
                        weird shenanigans inside his warehouse. Quasars, Queen Bees, Quadcopters...
                        Maybe you will find something interesting this time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You decided to head to the warehouse and see what Stephen needs help with.

                    <p>
                        As a habit of yours, you opened your memo and started a new entry.
                    </p>

                        (Enter <span class="password">WAREHOUSE</span> in your memo to proceed)
