                        You woke up with a knock on your door. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Hey Max, Stephen needs your help again," you opened the door and saw
                        Nicholas, your good friend.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Stephen is a good pal of yours, and the CEO of the Q-warehouse. You have 
                        helped with him a couple of times in the past, and previous encounters have suggested...
                        weird shenanigans inside his warehouse. Quasars, Queen Bees, Quadcopters...
                        Maybe you would find something interesting this time.
                        You decided to head to the warehouse and see what Stephen needs help with.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a habit of yours, you pulled up your memo and started a new entry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (Enter <span class="password">WAREHOUSE</span> in your memo to proceed)
                    </p>
