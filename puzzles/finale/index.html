                        "Thanks for your help, Max!" Stephen said. "Would you come over again in the future?"

                        "Uh..." you stuttered.

                        "Hmm, what's wrong?" Stephen asked.

                        You want to say someething, but you can't quite formulate your mind. So, 
                        you look at your memo. 
                        You feel that your previous <span class="password">memos</span> would be very useful in answering Stephen's question.
