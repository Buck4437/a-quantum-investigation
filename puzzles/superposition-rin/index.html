                        We might think that a measurement is like weighing an object. 
                        However, it is actually closer to asking a question.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The answer is like in a superposition state: 
                        the person might not even have an answer before you ask the question.
                        However, once you ask a question, the person must decide on an answer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Just like how you can change the colours of balls in boxes, 
                        maybe you can change the states of the answer before asking a question...
