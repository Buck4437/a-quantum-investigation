                        We might be inclined to think that a measurement is like weighting an object. 
                        However, it is actually closer to asking a question.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The answer is like in a superposition state, 
                        the person might not even have an answer before you ask the question!
                        However, once you ask a question, you will get an answer after asking it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Maybe, if you doing something before asking the question, you can alter the possibilities...
