                        "Uncertainty," you answer Stephen.

                        "While I would like to help you with your quantum warehouse, 
                        there are way too many uncertainties in life. Like the quantum packages or particles, 
                        I can never predict what would happen in life. I don't know if I would have time
                        to come over again."

                    <p>
                        "Therefore, I can't give a definite answer."

                        Stephen smiles. "It is okay," he replies. 
                        "Life is uncertain, but there is one thing that is certain: you are always welcomed
                        in the quantum realm. Just come over if you feel like it.
                        We can have dinner with Rin, Alice and Bob."

                    <p>
                        "Thank you for coming over."
                    </p>

                        Your investigation has come to an end. 
                        You write <span class="password">ENDING</span> in your memo.
