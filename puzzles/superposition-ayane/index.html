                        We might be inclined to think that a measurement is like weighting an object.<br>
                        However, it is actually closer to asking a question.<br> 
                        The result might not be defined before asking the question, 
                        but you will get an answer after asking it.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Maybe, asking out for a meal is like performing quantum measurement,<br>
                        and the answer behaves like in a state of superposition.<br>

                        You want to ask Ayana out for a meal.<br>
                        Professor Hiro has given you a secret weapon, a sensor that tells you the possibility of outcomes.<br>
                        You thanked Professor Hiro, set the sensor to tell you that, if Ayana would accept your invitation to a meal.
                        You saw Ayana at the sidewalk, and you pointed the sensor to Ayane:<br>
                        Possibility: 10^-20 %.<br><br>
                        Wow.<br>
                        However, you have prepared an extra sets of manevours, to hopefully bump up the possibility of getting a yes.<br>
                        After all, the answer is not defined before you ask her out!<br>
                        Use these manevours carefully, and tip the balance to your favour!
