                        "Do you know that you can teleport quantum states? Sounds cool, right?" 
                        Stephen brings you to a room that has a sign "Delivery". Both of you sit in front of 
                        a machine with a bunch of loose wires, a monitor, and what seems like a scanner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Stephen continues: "we will be sending some packages using this device right here.
                        However, I often run into issues when sending quantum information, so I thought that
                        you might be interested in joining."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Stephen turns on the monitor, and then he takes out a box from the storage room nearby.
                        You see a label on the box:
                    </p>

                    <img> (the labels should indicate number of balls, and their odds.)

                    <p>
                        "A company is ordering some quantum balls for their lucky draw, but they are on the other side of the Earth,"
                        Stephen says. 
                        "We can't just send the balls to them using trucks because the environment is too unstable. 
                        The states of the balls will probably collapse before reaching the company, and that's not good.
                        So, we will have to send the states of the ball using quantum teleportation."

                        All we need to do is to press a button... damn it, the analyser broke."

                        "Uh, can you help me with fixing it? 
                        We have a massively simplified version of the protocol on the computer,
                        just follow the instructions and it should be fine."

                        "Now we just need to email them this output, and they would be able to recover the balls!"

                        "Oh yeah, we can throw away the balls now. Quantum information cannot be copied,
