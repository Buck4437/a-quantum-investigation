                        He brought you to a room filled with packages.
                        He removes 16 packages from the shelf. Each of them has a label that looks like this:
                    </p>

                        He places them on a table, in a 4x4 grid. "Are these lootboxes?" You asked.

                    <p>

                            and prepares a new set of lootbox with the exact same labels.
                            "Now look at what happens when I do this."

                            He pulls out a mystical device from his pocket,
                            points it at the packages, and presses a button. 
                            The device radiates a strong blue light at the packages.

                            we can change the states of the objects inside the packages, 
                            and make everything blue," he explained.

                            until you open the lootbox. You have some chance of getting red, and some chance of getting blue.
                            This state is called a <span class="password">SUPERPOSITION</span> state."

                            "Of course, <span class="password">SUPERPOSITION</span> states aren't just limited to colours." 
                            He removed some more packages from the shelves. Their labels look like this:
